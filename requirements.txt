pip install openai

import openai

# To make this work, you will need an OpenAI API key. 
# Follow the instructions here to get one: https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart?context=python
# Then, create a .txt file with your API key and put it in the same directory as this notebook.
# The file should be called "openai-api-key.txt" and contain only your API key.
# Then, change the file name in the ai_chat.py file to "openai-api-key.txt"
